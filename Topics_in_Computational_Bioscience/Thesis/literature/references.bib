abstract = {Abstract A molecular mechanics force field implemented in the Sybyl program is described along with a statistical evaluation of its efficiency on a variety of compounds by analysis of internal coordinates and thermodynamic barriers. The goal of the force field is to provide good quality geometries and relative energies for a large variety of organic molecules by energy minimization. Performance in protein modeling was tested by minimizations starting from crystallographic coordinates for three cyclic hexapeptides in the crystal lattice with rms movements of 0.019 angstroms, 2.06 degrees, and 6.82 degrees for bond lengths, angles, and torsions, respectively, and an rms movement of 0.16 angstroms for heavy atoms. Isolated crambin was also analyzed with rms movements of 0.025 angstroms, 2.97 degrees, and 13.0 degrees for bond lengths, angles, and torsions respectively, and an rms movement of 0.42 angstroms for heavy atoms. Accuracy in calculating thermodynamic barriers was tested for 17 energy differences between conformers, 12 stereoisomers, and 15 torsional barriers. The rms errors were 0.8, 1.7, and 1.13 kcal/mol, respectively, for the three tests. Performance in general purpose applications was assessed by minimizing 76 diverse complex organic crystal structures, with and without randomization by coordinate truncation, with rms movements of 0.025 angstroms, 2.50 degrees, and 9.54 degrees for bond lengths, angles and torsions respectively, and an average rms movement of 0.192 angstroms for heavy atoms.},

With the rapid explosion of chemical ‘big’ data from HTS and combinatorial synthesis, machine learning has become an indispensable tool for drug designers to mine chemical information from large compound databases to design drugs with important biological properties. To process the chemical data, we first reviewed multiple processing layers in the chemoinformatics pipeline followed by the introduction of commonly used machine learning models in drug discovery and QSAR analysis. Here, we present basic principles and recent case studies to demonstrate the utility of machine learning techniques in chemoinformatics analyses; and we discuss limitations and future directions to guide further development in this evolving field.}

Among various AI applications, molecular property prediction can have more significant immediate impact to the drug discovery process since most algorithms and methods use predicted properties to evaluate, select, and generate molecules. Herein, we provide a brief review of the state-of-art molecular property prediction methodologies and discuss examples reported recently. We highlight key techniques that have been applied to molecular property prediction such as learned representation, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and federated learning. We also point out some critical but less discussed issues such as data set quality, benchmark, model performance evaluation, and prediction confidence quantification.}

Microbes have shown a remarkable ability in evading the killing actions of antimicrobial agents, such that treatment of bacterial infections represents once more an urgent global challenge. Understanding the initial bacterial response to antimicrobials may reveal intrinsic tolerance mechanisms to antibiotics and suggest alternative and less conventional therapeutic strategies. Here, we used mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to monitor the immediate metabolic response of Escherichia coli to a variety of antibiotic perturbations. We show that rapid metabolic changes can reflect drug mechanisms of action and reveal the active role of metabolism in mediating the first stress response to antimicrobials. We uncovered a role for ammonium imbalance in aggravating chloramphenicol toxicity and the essential function of deoxythymidine 5′-diphosphate (dTDP)-rhamnose synthesis for the immediate transcriptional upregulation of GyrA in response to quinolone antibiotics. Our results suggest bacterial metabolism as an attractive target to interfere with the early bacterial response to antibiotic treatments and reduce the probability for survival and eventual evolution of antibiotic resistance.}

abstract = {Summary
Solving the antibiotic resistance crisis requires the discovery of new antimicrobial drugs and the preservation of existing ones. The discovery of inhibitors of antibiotic resistance, antibiotic adjuvants, is a proven example of the latter. A major difficulty in identifying new antibiotics is the frequent rediscovery of known compounds, necessitating laborious “dereplication” to identify novel chemical entities. We have developed an antibiotic resistance platform (ARP) that can be used for both the identification of antibiotic adjuvants and for antibiotic dereplication. The ARP is a cell-based array of mechanistically distinct individual resistance elements in an identical genetic background. In dereplication mode, we demonstrate the rapid identification, and thus discrimination, of common antibiotics. In adjuvant discovery mode, we show that the ARP can be harnessed in screens to identify inhibitors of resistance. The ARP is therefore a powerful tool that has broad application in confronting the resistance crisis.}

This is especially compelling for tasks such as the prediction of molecular properties which is often one of the most crucial tasks in computer-aided drug discovery workflows. The immense hype surrounding these kinds of algorithms has led to the development of many different types of promising architectures and in this review we try to structure this highly dynamic field of AI-research by collecting and classifying 80 GNNs that have been used to predict more than 20 molecular properties using 48 different datasets.}
