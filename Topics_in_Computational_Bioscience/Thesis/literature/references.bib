abstract = {Abstract A molecular mechanics force field implemented in the Sybyl program is described along with a statistical evaluation of its efficiency on a variety of compounds by analysis of internal coordinates and thermodynamic barriers. The goal of the force field is to provide good quality geometries and relative energies for a large variety of organic molecules by energy minimization. Performance in protein modeling was tested by minimizations starting from crystallographic coordinates for three cyclic hexapeptides in the crystal lattice with rms movements of 0.019 angstroms, 2.06 degrees, and 6.82 degrees for bond lengths, angles, and torsions, respectively, and an rms movement of 0.16 angstroms for heavy atoms. Isolated crambin was also analyzed with rms movements of 0.025 angstroms, 2.97 degrees, and 13.0 degrees for bond lengths, angles, and torsions respectively, and an rms movement of 0.42 angstroms for heavy atoms. Accuracy in calculating thermodynamic barriers was tested for 17 energy differences between conformers, 12 stereoisomers, and 15 torsional barriers. The rms errors were 0.8, 1.7, and 1.13 kcal/mol, respectively, for the three tests. Performance in general purpose applications was assessed by minimizing 76 diverse complex organic crystal structures, with and without randomization by coordinate truncation, with rms movements of 0.025 angstroms, 2.50 degrees, and 9.54 degrees for bond lengths, angles and torsions respectively, and an average rms movement of 0.192 angstroms for heavy atoms.},
