\section{Introduction}\label{sec:inttroduction}
\noindent Molecules form the smallest identifiable parts of covalent compounds that still retain their chemical properties \cite{molecules}. These covalent compounds can be found in all organisms, since together they form integral parts like proteins or the DNA making an understanding of molecules and their properties key to deciphering the foundations of life. Since molecules are complex physical entities in 3D space consisting of covalent bonds between atoms, identifying their chemical, physical or biological properties is by no means a simple task. \emph{Molecular property prediction} aims to classify molecules according to their properties. In abstract terms this amounts to finding a nonlinear function from a class of molecules to a set of predefined properties. TODO: Other methods? \emph{In silico} methods to this by finding a mathematical representation of molecules serving as an input input for statistical or machine learning methods that try to learn the molecule's property. Classes of properties that have been of interest in the past are vast and comprise for example quantum-mechanic, physio-chemical, bio-physical or physiological properties \cite{wu2018moleculenet}. A biological application of MPP is falls in the area of drug discovery like antibiotics. Recently, there has been a huge breakthrough when et al discovered the new antibiotics halicin after decades of stagnation. They employed a Graph Neural Network that learned a mathematical representation
