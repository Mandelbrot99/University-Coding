\section{Introduction}\label{sec:inttroduction}
\noindent Molecules form the smallest identifiable parts of covalent compounds that still retain their chemical properties \cite{molecules}. These covalent compounds can be found in all organisms, since they form integral parts like proteins or the DNA making an understanding of molecules and their properties key to deciphering the foundations of life. Since molecules are complex physical entities in 3D space consisting of covalent bonds between atoms identifying their chemical, physical or biological properties is by no means a simple task. \emph{Molecular property prediction} aims to debunk the mysteries of molecules by finding a mathematical representation of molecules that can then be used as an input for statistical or machine learning methods that try to learn the molecule's property. Interesting classes of properties are vast and comprise for example quantum-mechanic, physio-chemical, bio-physical or physiological properties \cite{wu2018moleculenet}.
